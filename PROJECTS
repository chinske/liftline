This file lists features I would like to see in LIFTLINE.

- Add capability to model asymmetric wing loading.
- Modify LLT to model swept wings.
- Modify LLT to model compressibility.
- Implement Numerical Nonlinear Lifting-Line Method (see Anderson).
- Add capability to model a rolling wing.
- Add capability to impose an additional velocity field.
- Improve user interface; help guide the user through the problem.
- Build a UI to aid in building a planform geometry (ybp and cbp).
- Work on documentation.
- Answer, "Does it make sense to make LIFTLINE a part of AEROPACK?"
