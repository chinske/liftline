LIFTLINE

Overview
--------

LIFTLINE is a collection of MATLAB scripts and functions that
implement lifting-line theory.  It solves the monoplane equation to
estimate aerodynamic characteristics of a finite wing.  It also
provides capabilities to analyze shear force and bending moment along
the wing spar.

Installation
------------

No specific installation procedures are required.  Simply change the
current working directory within MATLAB to the top-level directory of
LIFTLINE.  Alternatively, add the top-level directory of LIFTLINE to
your MATLAB path.
