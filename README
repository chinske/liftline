LIFTLINE

Overview
--------

LIFTLINE is a collection of MATLAB scripts and functions that
implement lifting-line theory.  It solves the monoplane equation to
estimate aerodynamic characteristics of a finite wing.  It also
provides capabilities to analyze shear force and bending moment along
the wing spar.
